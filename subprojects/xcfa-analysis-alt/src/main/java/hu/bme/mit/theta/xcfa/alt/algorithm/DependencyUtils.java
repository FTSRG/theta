/**
 * Checks whether two transitions are dependent.
 * Two transitions are independent by definition, if
 * 1) One cannot disable the other
 * 2) Executing them in reverse order does not change the output
 *
 * Dependency can always be over-approximated.
 * We use the following fact:
 * Two transitions can only be dependent, if
 * 1) they are on the same process (hence can disable one another)
 * 2) one writes a variable the other accesses
 *
 * Note that two reads of the same variable are independent.
 *
 * Defining the dependency relation between two transition is easy:
 * If any depends on any transition, then they are dependent.
 * For two transition sets, any depends any -> dependent
